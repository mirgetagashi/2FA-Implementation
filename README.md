# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Android App

This project was developed as part of a university assignment to showcase the integration of authentication mechanisms in mobile applications.

It implements of a Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) system in an Android application using Java. The application provides an added layer of security by requiring users to verify their identity through two separate authentication steps:

1. Primary Authentication: Username and password.
2. Secondary Authentication: A One-Time Password (OTP) sent via email or SMS.
