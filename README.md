1. Primary Authentication: Username and password.
2. Secondary Authentication: A One-Time Password (OTP) sent via email or SMS.

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/mirgetagashi/2FAImplementation.git
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Go to Google Account Security and enable 2-Step Verification.
4. Generate an App Password to use in the application for secure email sending.
5. Build and run the application on an emulator or physical device.
